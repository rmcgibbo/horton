"""Store (parts of) a system object in a checkpoint file

   The philosophy of this module is to take away as much of the checkpointing
   machinery out of the rest of Horton. The only (somewhat unavoidable)
   exceptions to this philosophy are the ``load_checkpoint`` function in
   ``horton.io``, the ``from_hdf5`` and ``to_hdf5`` methods in several parts
   of Horton and calls to System.update_chk in several parts of the code.

   TODO: (long future) make the fields clever enough such that they can convert
   data from one linalgfactory into another.
