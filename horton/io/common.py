       **Arguments:**

       con_coeff
            The original contraction coefficient

       alpha
            The Gaussian exponent

       shell_type
            The shell_type as an integer. Must be one of the following: 0=s,

       reverse
            By default, the conversion is good for reading molden or orca wfn
            files. The opposite conversion can be done by setting this option to
            True. This is useful for writing molden or orca wfn files.
