'''Input and output routines

   All input routines begin with ``load_``. All output routines begin with
   ``dump_``.

   This package also contains a smart routine, ``load_system_args``, which makes
   it easier to load molecular data from various file formats. It uses to
   extension of the filename to figure out what the file format is.
