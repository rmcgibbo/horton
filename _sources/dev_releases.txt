* **June 1, 2013. Version 1.0.1**

   - Two bug fixes related to reading Gaussian formatted checkpoint files.

     1. The Gaussian 03 FCHK format contains a spelling error ('independant'
        instead of 'independent'). This is fixed in Gaussian 09. Both variants
        are now properly handled by Horton.
     2. Post-HF density matrices are read in properly.

   - Reorganization of mean-field code. It is now located in a sub package
     ``horton.meanfield``.
   - It is now impossible to start the SCF-ODA algorithm with a density matrix
     whose occupation numbers fall out of the admissible range. This prevents
     `fake` convergence to nonphysical solutions.
   - ESP fitting for isolated systems.


* **May 23, 2013. Version 1.0**

   - This release mainly focuses on real-space density partitioning
     (atoms-in-molecules) methods.
   - Other major features include: import wavefunctions from various
     file formats, basic Hartree-Fock and DFT algorithms (making user of libint
     and libxc), pruned integration grids up to Ar, checkpointing, ...
   - Experimental features: ESP fitting of charges and related algorithms,
     currently only for 3D periodic systems.
