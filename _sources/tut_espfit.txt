Introduction
============

The general idea behind the ESP fitting tools in Horton is to allow fitting
and assessment of charges in isolated and 3D-periodic systems with compatible
methodologies. Furthermore, the procedure is broken into different steps, such
that one can carry out more specialized ESP fits.

Two related computations, fitting of charges and testing the quality of charges
for the reproduction of the ESP, can be carried out once an ESP cost function
is constructed. In Horton, this ESP cost function takes the following form:

.. math::
    \text{COST}(\{q\}, \Delta V_\text{ref}) = \int_V d\mathbf{r} w(\mathbf{r}) \left(V_\text{ai}(\mathbf{r}) - \sum_A q_A V_\text{point}(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R}_A) - \Delta V_\text{ref} \right)^2

where the symbols have the following meaning:

* :math:`\{q\}`: the atomic charges
* :math:`V`: the volume where the point-charge ESP is compared with the
  reference ESP. In periodic systems, this is the volume of a single primitive
  cell. In isolated systems, this is some volume surrounding the molecule.
* :math:`w(\mathbf{r})` the weight function with range [0, 1] that selects the
  relevant parts of the volume for the ESP fit. In Horton, the weight function
  of Hu, Lu and Yang is used. [hu2007]_ This weight function is zero far away
  from and inside the atoms. It becomes one in the part of the electron density
  tail where non-bonding contacts are typically found. The weight function
  smoothly varies from 0 to 1. In the Hu-Lu-Yang paper, a pro-density is
  recommended for this purpose while we recommend to use a proper all-electron
  density or a corrected pseudo-density.
* :math:`V_\text{ai}(\mathbf{r})` is the ab initio ESP computed with some other
  program, e.g. Gaussian, CP2K, VASP, etc.
* :math:`q_A` are the atomic charges
* :math:`V_\text{point}(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R}_A)` is the electrostatic
  potential due to a unit point charge. In an isolated molecule, this is simply
  :math:`1/|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R}_A|` (in atomic units). For periodic systems,
  this part is quite a bit more involved.
* :math:`\Delta V_\text{ref}` is a constant that may account for differences in
  reference between the ab initio ESP and the point charge ESP.
  The need for such a term was established in the REPEAT paper for ESP fitting
  in 3D periodic systems. [campana2009]_

This approach differs from traditional ESP fitting methods (RESP, MKS, CHELPG)
in the sense that the cost function is defined as an integral rather than a sum
over sampling points. This idea comes from the Hu-Lu-Yang paper. [hu2007]_
The main difference with the REPEAT method [campana2009]_ is that the selected
volume for the fit is defined by a smooth weight function. When this weight
function is based on an all-electron density, there is no need to define atomic
radii as is done usually in ESP fitting.

The cost function is obviously a quadratic function of the unknown parameters,
:math:`X`: the charges (and :math:`\Delta V_\text{ref}` in the case of
a 3D periodic system), which we can always write as follows:

.. math::
    \text{COST}(X) = X^T A X - 2 B^T X - C

The script ``horton-esp-cost.py`` construct the matrix :math:``A``, the vector
:math:`B` and the constant :math`C`. These results are stored in an HDF5 file
that is subsequently used by the script ``horton-esp-fit.py`` to obtain
ESP-fitted charges or by the script ``horton-esp-test.py`` to evaluate the
cost function for a given set of charges.

In the output of these three scripts, the following quantities are reported (if
applicable):

* :math:`\text{RMSD} = \sqrt{\text{COST}/V_w}`
* :math:`\text{RRMSD} = \sqrt{\text{COST}/C}` (expressed as a percentage)

where the cost is computed with a certain set of charges (and the optimal
:math:`\Delta V_\text{ref}` when applicable). The parameter :math:`V_w` is the
integral of the weight function. When these charges are the ESP fitted charges,
:math:`\text{COST}`, :math:`\text{RMSD}` and :math:`\text{RRMSD}` are minimal.
When the charges are all set to zero, one obtains the worst-case value for
:math:`\text{COST}=C`, :math:`\text{RMSD}=\sqrt{C/V_w}` and
:math:`\text{RRMSD}=100\%`. (One can can still obtain a higher
:math:`\text{COST}`, but only with completely insensible charges. When that is
the case, it is better to set the charges to zero to model the ESP.)


``horton-esp-cost.py`` -- Set up an ESP cost functions
======================================================

The script ``horton-esp-cost.py`` can be used to construct the cost function for
the ESP fitting.

The recommended usage for an all-electron computation is as follows::

    horton-esp-cost.py esp.cube cost.h5 --wdens=rho.cube --pbc={000|111}

where ``esp.cube`` is a Gaussian cube file containing the ESP data. The results will
be written in ``cost.h5``. The option ``--wdens=rho.cube`` implies that the
weight function is constructed with the Hu-Lu-Yang method using the given
density cube file. [hu2007]_ The opton ``--pbc`` can be used to construct a cost
function for an isolated system (``000``) or a 3D periodic system (``111``).

When a pseudo-potential computation is used, the density cube file contains
regions of low electron density close to the nucleus. These regions may not be
excluded from the fit with the Hu-Lu-Yang weight function. Therefore, Horton
allows one to build up the weight function as a product of several factors:
:math:`w(\mathbf{r}) = w_1(\mathbf{r})w_2(\mathbf{r})w_3(\mathbf{r})w_4(\mathbf{r}) \ldots`, where the
first one is typically the Hu-Lu-Yang weight function and additional weight
functions can be included for every pseudo-core,

The recommended usage for a pseudo-potential computation is as follows::

    horton-esp-cost.py esp.cube cost.h5 --wdens=rho.cube --pbc={000|111} --wnear Z1:r1:gamma1 [Z2:r2:gamma2 ...]

where one new option, ``--wnear``, is used. This option takes at least one
argument. One such argument must be present for every element in the system for
which a pseudo potential is used. The parameter ``Z1`` is the atomic number. The
parameter ``r1`` is the radius of the core region that one would like to
exclude. The parameter ``gamma1`` determines how quickly the weight factor for
elements ``Z1`` switch from 0 (inside a sphere with radius ``r1``) to 1 (outside
a sphere with radius ``r1``). Both ``r1`` and ``gamma1`` must be given in
angstrom.

The script ``horton-esp-cost.py`` has several more options. Run
``horton-esp-cost.py --help`` for more details.


``horton-esp-fit.py`` -- Fit charges to the ESP
===============================================

Once a cost function is constructed, it can be used estimate atomic charges by
minimizing the cost function. A bare-bones fit can be carried out as follows::

    horton-esp-fit.py cost.h5 charges.h5

where the file ``cost.h5`` is constructed with the script
``horton-esp-cost.py``.

Useful ESP fitted charges typically involve much more advanced minimizations of
the ESP cost function, for example by adding constraints, restraints,
transforming to bond-charge increments, fitting to several different molecules
concurrently, etc. Such advanced features are not supported in
``horton-esp-fit.py`` but one is free to implement these in customized scripts
that use the the ESP cust functions obtained with ``horton-esp-cost.py``.


``horton-esp-test.py`` -- Test the ESP quality of a given set of charges
========================================================================

The script ``horton-esp-test.py`` can be used to test the quality of a set of
charges for the reproduction of the ESP. These charges are typically obtained
with ``horton-wpart.py`` or ``horton-cpart.py``. It can be used as follows::

    horton-esp-test.py cost.h5 wpart.h5:hi/charges wpart_espcost.h5:hi

The first file, ``cost.h5``, is generated with the script
``horton-esp-cost.py``. The second file, ``wpart.h5`` is generated (for example)
with ``horton-wpart.py gaussian.fchk wpart.h5:hi hi atoms.h5``. The last file,
``wpart_espcost.h5`` will contain the output in the HDF5 group ``hi``.
