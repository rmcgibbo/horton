How to contribute to Horton
###########################


.. contents::


This chapter discusses all the technology and conventions that make it fun to
work on Horton with a small team, and to make sure things remain manageable
as the elephant grows bigger and bigger.

Although the development of Horton is a rather informal business, it is not a
bad idea to follow some guidelines to guarantee the quality of the program. A
general overview of these guidelines are presented in the first section. The
subsequent section discuss the technical aspects in more detail: how to
work with git, how to write unit tests, how to write documentation, etc.


Coding guidelines
=================

The following guidelines may feel a bit frustrating in the beginning, but it
avoids a lot of frustration in the long run.

1. **Write unit tests (validation routines) for new pieces of code. Commit new
   code and tests in one patch.**

   Writing unit tests is difficult, especially for newcomers, but it is really
   necessary to maintain to keep Horton functional. Only fools believe they can
   write bug-free code without testing. It always takes some creativity to
   devise test routines, certainly in Horton. Some examples are given below, but
   feel free to blur the lines. Just make sure a test does not take too long to
   execute (i.e. not more than a second).

   * Check whether a computational result is translational invariant.
   * Compare energies from atomic computations with published results, or
     results obtained with other (reliable) programs.
   * Compare analytical derivatives with finite differences.
   * Compare the output of a routine with a results derived on paper.

   In most cases, it is sufficient to imagine what `could` go wrong if your new
   code `would` be buggy.

   *Important:* Avoid tests that just check the output of a routine with the output
   from a previous version of the code. Such tests need to be redone each time
   a bug is found in that routine.

2. **Never commit a patch that breaks the tests.**

   The purpose of the tests is to keep the program working as we add more
   features. When a patch breaks previous tests, it is simply unacceptable.

3. **Ask someone to review your patches before they go into the official master
   branch.**

   It is perfectly OK to work in your own branch and do there whatever you like.
   It is also OK to upload these branches, such that others can see and review
   your code. As soon as one of your branches is mature enough, use ``git
   rebase`` to apply your patches to the master branch.

4. **When you find a bug, first write a test that fails because of the bug. Then
   fix the bug. Commit both test and fix in one patch.**

   This is a great way of fixing bugs and making tests. It also guarantees that
   the bug you found will not be reintroduced accidentally in later versions of
   Horton.

5. **Write lots of comments, doc-strings, documentation and examples.**

   `Comments` are needed for obvious reasons.

   `Doc-strings` are a rather Pythonic thing to do. More information about
   doc-strings can be found `here <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257#what-is-a-docstring>`_.

   `The documentation` is written in `ReStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
   and compiled with `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ into the fancy
   webpage you are currently looking at. More details on the documentation
   system are given below.

   `Examples` are simple python scripts that use Horton to run a computation.
   Keep these examples simple, e.g. no more than 20 lines, and add abundant
   comments that explain every line.

6. **Adopt a clean coding style.**

   There is an extensive `Style Guide for Python Code <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
   The main purpose is to make the source code easier to read and maintain.
   These are the basics:

   * Never use tabs. Always use four spaces to indent code.
   * Use UpperCamelCase for class names. All other names are written in lower
     case, with underscores to separate different words in a name. Never use
     headlessCamelCase.
   * Separate top-level blocks in a module by two blank lines.
   * Separate methods in a class with one blank line.
   * Doc-strings also have a specific format:
        1. A one-line summary, followed by a blank line.
        2. Description of the arguments, followed by a blank line.
        3. Description of the return value(s), followed by a blank line.
           (optional)
        4. Some extra paragraphs with detailed information. (optional)
   * Use self-explaining names for classes, variables, functions, methods. Start
     functions and methods with a verb.
   * Never use ``from foo import *`` in a Horton module. Always specify what is
     to be imported, or use the ``import foo`` or ``import foo as bar`` syntax.
   * Avoid long lines, i.e. no longer than 80 characters. Use the line-wrapping
     features in Python to break long lines into smaller ones.

   Specific conventions for Horton

   * Import the Numpy package as follows: ``import numpy as np``.
   * Import the H5Py package as follows: ``import h5py as h5``.
   * Use single-letter variable names ``i``, ``j``, ``k`` and ``l`` only for
     integer loop variables.


Git: the fast version control system
====================================

Horton uses `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ for version control.

This section goes through
the basics. Although the commands below are specific for Git, most of the
good practices are general and also apply to other modern VCSs such Bazaar
or Mercurial. There are however a few old-fashioned systems such as CVS (and to
some extent Subversion), that do not (or only poorly) support some of the
guidelines below. Of all the VCSs out there, Git is probably the most snappy, and
definitely the most popular for new projects. Git is also the only widely
adopted open-source VCS for the development of commercial software.

The purpose of a VCS is to allow many different people to make modifications in the same
program without messing things up. VCS software also makes life much easier for
someone who has to merge different developments into one common source tree.


Configuring Git
---------------

Make a file ~/.gitconfig as follows::

    [user]
        name = Toon Verstraelen
        email = Toon.Verstraelen@UGent.be

    [color]
        diff = always
        status = always
        interactive = always
        branch = always

    [branch]
        autosetuprebase = always

    [branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = master

    [push]
        default = simple

Replace my name and email by yours. If you are also working on other projects
that use git, it may be useful to move some of these options to the file
``.git/config`` in the Horton source tree.


Furthermore, it is useful to include the current branch in your shell promt. Put
one of the following in your ``~/.bashrc`` file:

* For terminals with a dark background::

    GIT_PS='$(__git_ps1 ":%s")'
    export PS1="\[\033[1;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\] \[\033[1;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\[\033[1;33m\]${GIT_PS}\[\033[1;34m\]>\[\033[00m\] "

* For terminals with a light background::

    GIT_PS='$(__git_ps1 ":%s")'
    export PS1="\[\033[2;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[2;34m\]\w\[\033[3;31m\]${GIT_PS}\[\033[00m\]$ "

Add salt and pepper to taste. You may also want to add a line ``export
PROMPT_DIRTRIM=3`` to keep the shell prompt short.


Some terminology
----------------

Patch
    A set of changes in the source code. These are typically recorded in a
    `patch` file. Such a file specifies a set of lines that are removed and
    a set of lines that are added.

`SHA-1 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1>`_ hash
    A `numerical` checksum of a given length in bytes (in this case 256) for a
    much larger amount of data, e.g. a very long character string. One tries to
    design hashing algorithms such that they are doing two things very well: (i) it
    is not possible to derive the original data from a hash and (ii) a small
    change in the original data completely changes the hash. The `MD5 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5>`_ checksum is
    well known and often used from CD images, but it is not great in terms of
    the above two hashing objectives.

Commit (git specific)
    A patch with a some extra information: author, timestamp, a SHA1 hash of the
    code to which it applies, and some other things.

Branch
    A series of commits that describe the history of the source code.

    In realistic projects, the source code history is not linear, but contains
    many deviations from the `official branch` where people try to implement a
    new feature. It is however useful to have only one official linear history.
    We will show below how this can be done with git.

Branch head
    The last commit in a branch.


Work flow for adding a new feature
----------------------------------

The development of a new feature typically consists of three large steps: (i)
modifications to the code in a separate branch, (ii) review of the new code,
fixing problems and (iii) rebase your branch on top of the master branch and
publish.


Develop the feature in a separate branch
........................................

1. Switch to the master branch if needed::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:foo> git checkout master
    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master>

   The master branch is the official branch of Horton. Also make sure there
   are no uncommitted changes in the source code before switching to the
   master branch.

2. Get the latest version of the official code::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master> git pull

3. Make a new branch::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master> git checkout -b bar
    toony@poony ~/.../horton:bar>

   Only start changing the code and committing patches once you have changed
   to this new branch for the implementation of feature `bar`.

4. Make some changes in the source code. When adding a new feature, also add
   tests, documentation, docstrings, comments and examples for that feature.
   (The more tests and documentation, the better.)

5. Review your changes with ``git diff``. Make sure there are no trailing spaces
   or trailing blank lines. These can be removed with the ``./cleancode.sh``
   script. If you created new files, run the ``./updateheaders.py`` script to
   make sure the new files have the proper headers.

6. Review the changed/new files with ``git status``

7. Select the files/changes that will be committed with ``git add``. There are
   two ways to do this:

   * Add all changes in certain files::

        toony@poony ~/.../horton:bar> git add horton/file1.py horton/file2.py ...

   * Interactively go through the changes in all/some files::

        toony@poony ~/.../horton:bar> git add -p [horton/file1.py horton/file2.py ...]

8. Commit the selected files to your working branch::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:bar> git commit -m 'Short description'

In practice, you'll make a few commits before a new feature is finished. After
adding a few commits, testing them thoroughly, you are ready for the next step.


Make your branch available for review
.....................................

In order to let someone look at your code, you have to make your branch
available by pushing it to a remote server. One may use `Github
<http://www.github.com>`_ for this purpose.

1. Configure your repository for the remote server::

    git remote add review <paste_your_remote_url_here>

2. Push your branch to the remote server::

    git push remote bar:bar

Now send the URL of your remote server and the name of the branch to a peer for
review. If you are looking for someone to review your code, post a request on
the `Horton mailing list <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/horton-discuss>`_

Unless, you have written spotless code, you will make some further modifications
to the code, commit these and push them to the remote server for review. Once
this iterative process has converged, it is time to move to the next step.


Rebase your branch on top of the master branch
..............................................

It is likely that during the development of your feature, the master branch
has evolved with new commits added by other developers. You need to append your
branch to the new HEAD of the master branch with the program ``git rebase``

1. Switch to the master branch::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:bar> git checkout master
    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master>

2. Get the latest version of the official code::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master> git pull

3. Switch to your working branch::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master> git checkout bar
    toony@poony ~/.../horton:bar>

4. Create a new branch in which the result of ``git rebase`` will be stored.

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:bar> git checkout -b bar-1
    toony@poony ~/.../horton:bar-1>


4. `Rebase` your commits on top of the latest master branch::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:bar-1> git rebase master

..

    This command will try to apply the patches from your working branch to the
    master branch. It may happen that others have changed the official version
    such that your patches do no longer simply apply. When that is the case,
    the ``git rebase`` script will interrupt and tell you what to do. Do not
    panic when this happens. If you feel uncertain about how to resolve
    conflicts, it is time to call your git-savvy friends for help.

5. Run all tests again once the rebase procedure is completed. If needed fix
   problems and commit the changes.

6. Upload the commits to your remote server::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:bar-1> git push review bar-1:bar-1

Now you can get in touch with one of the Horton developers (at the `Horton
mailing list <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/horton-discuss>`_) to transfer
these new patches to the public master branch of Horton.


Unit tests
==========

Horton uses the `Nosetests <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
program to run all the unit tests. The goal of a unit test is to check whether
as small piece of code works as expected.


Running the tests
-----------------

The tests are run as follows (including preparation steps)::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master> ./cleanfiles.sh
    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master> ./setup.py build_ext -i
    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master> nosetests -v

This will run the tests with the version of Horton in the source tree, i.e. not
the one that is installed with ``python setup.py install``. There are some cases
where the first two commands are not needed. You will figure out.

When working on a specific part of the code, it is often convenient to limit the
number of tests that are checked. The following runs only the tests in ``horton/test/test_cell.py``::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master> nosetests -v horton/test/test_cell.py

Within one file, one may also select one test function::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master> nosetests -v horton/test/test_cell.py:test_from_parameters3


Writing new tests
-----------------

All tests in Horton are located in the directories ``horton/test`` and
``horton/*/test``. All module files containing tests have a filename that starts
with ``test_``. In these modules, all functions with a name that starts with
``test_`` are picked up by Nosetests. Tests that do not follow this convention,
are simply ignored.

The basic structure of a test is as follows::

    def test_sum():
        a = 1
        b = 2
        assert a+b == 3

Horton currently contains many examples that can be used as a starting point
for new tests. The easiest way to write new tests is to just copy an existing
test (similar to what you have in mind) and start modifying it.

Most test packages in ``horton`` contain a ``common`` module that contains useful
functions that facilitate the development of tests. An important example is the
``check_delta`` function to test of analytical derivatives are properly
implemented. This is a simple example::


    import numpy as np
    from horton.common import check_delta

    def test_quadratic():
        # a vector function that computes the squared norm divided by two
        def fun(x):
            return np.dot(x, x)/2

        # the gradient of that vector function
        def deriv(x):
            return x

        # the dimension of the vector x
        ndim = 5
        # the number of small displacements used in the test
        ndisp = 100
        # a reference point used for the test of the analytical derivatives
        x0 = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, ndim)
        # the small displacements, i.e. each row is one (small) relative vector
        dxs = np.random.uniform(1e-5, 1e5, (ndisp, ndim))

        check_delta(fun, deriv, x0, dxs)


Writing tests that need a temporary directory
---------------------------------------------

A context manager is implemented in ``horton.test.common`` to simplify tests
that need a temporary working directory. It can be used as follows::

    from horton.test.common import tmpdir

    def test_something():
        with tmpdir('horton.somemodule.test.test_something') as dn:
            # dn is a string with the temporary directory name.
            # put here the part of the test that operates in the temporary directory.

On most systems, this temporary directory is a subdirectory of ``/tmp``. The
argument ``'horton.somemodule.test.test_something'`` will occur in the directory
name, such that it can be easily recognized if needed.


Documentation
=============

All the documentation is located in the ``doc`` directory. We use the `Sphinx
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ formatting engine to compile the `documentation
source code` into fancy formatted HTML or PDF.

The source files have the extension ``.rst``, and are written in the
`ReStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (RST) format.
RST is in some sense comparable to latex, but more intuitive to use.
It also has some specific advantages for documenting software.

All ``.rst``-files are part of the source tree, just like the actual source
code. Git is also used to keep track of changes in the documentation.

There is a makefile to generate the documentation based in the source code::

    toony@poony ~/.../horton:master> cd doc
    toony@poony ~/.../horton/doc:master> make html
    toony@poony ~/.../horton/doc:master> make pdf

Whenever you add a new feature, make sure that at least files
``lib_horton*.rst`` are up to date. With more serious work, please also write
a tutorial, e.g. like this one, to explain how your new feature can be used
effectively. If you added a significant feature, also update the file
``ref_features.rst``.


Examples
========

The examples are located in the ``examples`` directory. Each example is located
in a subdirectory ``XXX_some_name``, where ``XXX`` is a counter. In each
subdirectory there is an executable script ``run.py`` that demonstrates a
feature. Additional input files may be provided here for the example to work.
For each example, there is also a corresponding test in
``horton/test/test_examples.py`` Please, follow these conventions when adding a
new example.

The file ``run.py`` should not contain more than 50 lines of functional Python
code, preferably even less. Put excessive comments before each line to explain
how the example work. Also write the test such that it does not take more than a
second to complete.


Citing scientific work
======================

Whenever you add a feature based on a scientific publication, it should be cited
properly:

1. Add an item to the file ``data/references.bib``. Include the ``doi`` if
   possible. (The ``url`` field can be used as an alternative if the ``doi`` is
   not available.) Maintain the chronological order.

2. Add ``log.cite('someref', 'a reason')`` to the code based on the publication, e.g.\
   ``log.cite('marques2012', 'using LibXC, the library of exchange and correlation functionals')``.

3. Update the references in ``doc/ref_literature.rst`` by running the script
   ``updateliterature.sh``.
